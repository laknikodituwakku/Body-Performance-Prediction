# Body-Performance-Prediction model

This repository contains a machine learning model developed to predict an individual's performance class based on their physical characteristics and performance on physical tests using the Body Performance dataset. The model was developed using Python and utilizes various open-source libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.

# Dataset
The Body Performance dataset consists of 13393 observations and 12 variables, including age, gender, body fat percentage, height, weight, blood pressure, grip strength, flexibility, sit-ups, broad jump, and performance class (A, B, C, or D). The dataset was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kukuroo3/body-performance-data).

# Exploratory Data Analysis
An Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to gain insights into the Body Performance dataset. The analysis was carried out using Jupyter and the findings are included in the Jupyter Notebook file named "eda_1_FINAL.ipynb" and "eda_2_FINAL.ipynb". The notebook includes visualizations of the variables and their distributions, as well as correlations between the variables.

# Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model was developed to predict an individual's performance class based on their physical characteristics and performance on physical tests. The model was developed using Python and utilizes various open-source libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. The model was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
